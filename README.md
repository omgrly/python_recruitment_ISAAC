# Temperature logger

Our robot is mainly realized with a popular 3D printed material called PLA. This material softens at around 50° Celsius, and deformation can occur when a temperature higher than this lasts for a prolonged amount of time. 

To keep track of possible damages to the robot's chassis, we want to log every time our robot’s temperature reaches 50° Celsius in a text file containing the time of the event and the temperature detected. 

For this purpose a ROS2 package called `temperature_log` has been created, and is included in this repository. In particular, the main code for this package is inside `temperature_log/temperature_log/logger.py`. 

In that file a `TemperatureLogger` class should be implemented, with the following structure. Feel free to add methods and attributes if you need. You can also import any module from the Python Standard Library.

```mermaid
classDiagram
class TemperatureLogger {
    + __init__(filename: str)
	+ callback(temperature: Float32)
}
```

> **Note**
> The callback method receives the temperature as a `Float32` parameter. To get the `float` value, you'll need to unpack it using `temperature.data`.

## The simple way

The quickest way to solve this task is just editing the `logger.py` file, however you can't **directly** test the code you write since you'll be missing the dependencies to run it. To make sure your code works you'll have to find another way to **test the class** you create. Unless you trust your coding skills enough! :)

If you're still reading and up for a challenge, we include an extremely condensed guide on how to setup a ROS2 environment. While this is not required, this is what you'd do in the team. 



## The ROS way 

While **you don't need to use ROS at all** to implement and test the code you're asked to write, we still provide the basic steps to obtain a working ROS2 Iron environment in a **Ubuntu 22.04** environment. 

If you decide to try it, we suggest using WSL (if using Windows) or any other containerization/virtualization environment, to easily rollback any changes. 

### ROS install

The following is a summary of the instructions found in ROS2 documentation [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).

```bash
# enable universe repository
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository universe

# add ROS2 repository key
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

# add ROS2 repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

# install ROS2 and necessary packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-iron-ros-base ros-dev-tools python3-colcon-common-extensions -y

# setup environment for ROS2 development
source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
```

The last line should be executed every time you open a new bash shell. Alternatively, you can add it at the end of the `.bashrc` file in your user home.

### ROS workspace setup

Following are based upon [this tutorial by ROS](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html).

```bash
# create folder structure
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws

# clone this repository in the src folder
git clone https://github.com/Team-Isaac-Polito/python_recruitment src/python_recruitment

# build the project
colcon build

# setup the environment for this project
. install/local_setup.bash
```

### ROS launch

After all the previous steps, you can finally start the code. To do so, a ROS launch file has been provided. Make sure the shell you're using is setup correctly using the `.bash` indicated by the previous two code blocks, then use the following command.

```bash
ros2 launch temperature_log temperature_log_launch.py
```

This will not only start the code in `logger.py`, but also the `publisher.py` file (node in ROS terms). This node will send a random value to the logger node, allowing you to see if the code you wrote is working!
